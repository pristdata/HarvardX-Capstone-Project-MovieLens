# HarvardX-Capstone-Project-MovieLens

The aim of this capstone project was to employ the R-programming and statistics skills obtained throughout the course as well as applying the learned machine learning techniques to create a movie recommendation system. A machine learning algorithm was trained to predict user movie ratings (0 to 5 stars) in a validation set using the inputs of a provided subset.
